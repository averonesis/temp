# Project pages : 

1. Homepage
2. FAQ page
3. Plans page
4. Sign up / Login
5. Profile / Functionality page 



## Homepage

The page I sent already has almost all the functionality : 

1. Transparent to opaque navbar on scroll
2. Canvas particlejs + background image
3. 2 input bars api-key:f7b8e545c16c58a2969090f065006760 (magnet + torrent)
4. **
5. "How does this work?" Flexbox with 3 elements + icons
6. Footer for sitemap (Example : https://www.namecheap.com/, https://www.amazon.com/, etc) (empty for now)


+ **4 :  Only thing currently missing in homepage, is one div that will contain information about torrents uploaded in input bars.
User will upload magnet link or torrent, and when they submit, this div will animate/expand vertically and become visible.
There is a request sent to server with magnet and torrent link, and response will be displayed in this div as a table.

Sample response : 

```JSON
    {
       "name" : "Sintel",
        "filesize" : "10MB",
        "files" : 10,
        "created" : "10 Mar. 2016",
        "seeders" : 100,
        "peers" : 10,
        "health" : "green" //yellow, red
    }
```

#### !important : Do not worry about api/ajax requests. You can just code the animations + css using sample data.

It would be preferred to write a function for the animation above to call, so we can easily call it later.

## FAQ Page 

![Photo example of one FAQ element](https://puu.sh/DknJT/198567efc1.png)

1. Same navbar as homepage, but always opaque. And not fixed, it stays up when scrolling.
2. Clear background with only FAQ questions.
3. Each FAQ question has minimum width for very short questions, or width = text length for most questions.
4. When FAQ element expands, each FAQ element becomes page width (minus margin or padding, see what looks nice for you!)
5. Same footer as homepage.

#### !important : Every page below should follow same logic above for navbar + footer. So only homepage will have transparent navbar.

## Plans Page

I don't have a specific design for pricing plans, so I will let you pick what you see best.

Some examples : 

https://slack.com/intl/en-ma/pricing

https://www.surveymonkey.com/pricing/

https://www.semrush.com/prices/

If you don't like those you can still use any design you like. But I have some points about functionality : 

1. One box should be bigger sized than the others, similar example to semrush.com.
2. There will be 4 pricing plans. (One free plan on the left.)
3. There are buttons at the bottom of every pricing plan, with special display logic : 
    + Logic 1 : User is not registered on website. All paid plans are greyed out. And only free plan button is available, it redirects to signup page.
    + Logic 2 : User is now logged in. Free plan button is whited out. All paid plans are clickable and they redirect to a payment processor.
    + Logic 3 : User is logged in and on paid plan. All lower paid plans are whited out, all higher paid plans have are clickable with different text (ex. Upgrade plan).

 4. Include one extra div for payment methods above footer and under plans.

## Login / Signup Page

I also have no specific design in mind. So just design something similar to website theme.

1. No navbar or footer.
2. Signup form includes username, email, double password, submit button.
3. +Breakline : "Or [Login](./#) if you already have an account." Changes form to user + pass + submit form.
4. Maybe background or js animation, but not necessary. All the design is up to you.

I was also thinking of adding small login jquery box to homepage.

## Profile page / Functionality page

These pages might be a single page, but might have a lot of animation. (Stats, Settings, Upload).. 
I do not know what exactly is needed so I'm just adding them here for the future reference. Once I complete backend I will know more about what will be needed.
